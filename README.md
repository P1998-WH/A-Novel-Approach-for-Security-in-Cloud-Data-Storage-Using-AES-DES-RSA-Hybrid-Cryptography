# A-Novel-Approach-for-Security-in-Cloud-Data-Storage-Using-AES-DES-RSA-Hybrid-Cryptography
The key is generated right after the data is encrypted. The data is encrypted into three parts. First the program divides the data into 3 different part and the algorithm is used on each part to encrypt it. First, second and third part is encrypted using the AES, DES and RSA algorithms respectively. After the encryption each algorithm generates its own individual key. Each key encrypts some part of the data. Then the recipient sends the request to the sender for encrypted data and the key. The owner will accept it from his ID and recipient will use it to decrypt using each key. The recipient will enter key and the algorithm will decrypt the data simultaneously. A broad flowchart of the process of key generation from encrypting to finally decrypting the data.
